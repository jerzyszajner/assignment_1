## Brief Description:

Challenges Faced:
One of the challenges in this project was implementing a smooth scrolling effect for the image gallery. I encountered issues with scroll behavior and consulted GPT for guidance on achieving the desired effect. This helped me understand and apply CSS properties like scroll-snap-type effectively to enhance the user experience.

### Technologies and Features:

HTML and CSS: Built with HTML and CSS, the site provides a clean layout and aesthetic design.

**Flexbox and Grid:** Flexbox and Grid are used to create responsive sections that adapt to various screen sizes.

**Responsive Design:** Media queries ensure the site performs well on tablets and mobile devices, including landscape mode.
